# Hi-Quadratic-
# Quadratic Equation Solver and Graph Plotter

This program solves quadratic equations and plots their corresponding graphs. It utilizes the `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `cmath` libraries.

## Usage

To run the program, execute the `ax.py` file. You'll be prompted whether you want to continue or not. By entering `yes`, you can input the quadratic equation coefficients and it will be solved and graphically represented.

## Important Notes

- The coefficients of the quadratic equation should be entered in the form `ax^2 + bx + c`.
- If the coefficient `a` is equal to zero, an error message will be displayed.
- If the discriminant `delta` is negative, complex roots and the absence of real solutions will be displayed.
- If invalid inputs are entered, an error message will be displayed.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, use the following commands:
```sh
pip install numpy matplotlib cmath platform
```
```sh
python ax.py
```

## Supported Operating Systems

The program has been tested on both Windows and Linux operating systems.

## Example

```python
Enter a = 1
Enter b = -3
Enter c = 2
delta = 1.0
x1 = 2.0
x2 = 1.0
```
